# Terrain Classification from Time Series Data

## Background

Humans naturally develop walking capability that is energy efficient, stable, environment adaptive and robust. Lower limb amputations, unfortunately, disrupt this 
ability; individuals with lower limb amputations usually depend on prosthetic devices to restore the basic walking function. Lower-limb robotic prosthetics can 
benefit from context awareness to provide enhanced comfort and safety to the amputee. In this work, we aim to develop a terrain identification system based on 
inertial measurement units IMU streams collected from the lower limb. The system for a prosthetic leg uses visual and inertial sensors though, but we are willing 
to observe if terrain identification without the visual data is viable.

## Task

This is a classification task to find different terrains from time series data. We will use F1 score as the evaluation metric of this project.
